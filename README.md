# Setup 

Code repository containing all the tools needed to start off with a frontend project.

## How to use it?

Every folder caters to one type of setup. Inside each of them:
1. Copy the `package.json` into your new project folder and run `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies. 
2. Copy the other folders too: `config` for all the webpack configs, `src` for the source of your project
3. Copy the config files `.eslintrc.json`, `.prettierrc`, etc - the rules inside these can be modified later

Additionally, setup your editor for the dependecies such as linters and code formatters to perform actions on file save
